# Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description
This project was created so we can show that we know how to use Third-Party APIs and the Moment.js library so we can work with dates and time. In each time slot you write down in event and click on the save button to the right of it and it will be saved 
to local storage and be present next time you load up the webpage. The timeblocks will also change color depending on the time of the day.
